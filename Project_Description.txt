Shift Scheduling App

Repo Link: https://github.com/GuardianBob/ShiftScheduler

Idea came from my wife's work, an emergency vet hospital, where they still build shift schedules in a spreadsheet on google drive.  
The scheduler will have the main calendar on the home screen, displaying all currently scheduled shifts.

Users will have a profile page where they can update contact information and see the total number of shifts they have scheduled for the month and year.
	- Doctors often have to spend time manually totaling the number of shifts they've worked.  They also have to deal with identifying what time of shift it was.
	
Admins will be able to add shifts, update the schedule, and modify other attributes such as shift-type coloring.

Admins will have access to a page that shows total shifts planned for each doctor for the month and year, allowing for faster and more accurate balancing of shifts.

Users will be able to create a login in order to be able to view the schedule.

Admins will also be able to add users.

Initial Functionality:
	- User Registration/Login
	- View calendar with shifts listed on each day
	- Schedule Doctor for shifts
	- User Profile with contact information
	- Shift count per doctor for month/year
	- Add/Edit/Delete Shift
	- Add/Edit/Delete Shift Type

Additional Functionality that can be added later:
	- Announcement system to send emails to all doctors
	- Time off and schedule switch system for doctors to put in documented requests for time off or to swap shifts with another doctor
	- Semi-automated scheduling for individual doctors: Admin can select the doctor, shift, and what days of the month to pre-populate.
	- Calendar view for scheduling individual doctors.
	- Export to different file types (xml, csv, etc.)
	- Automated notifications of shift changes/updates.
