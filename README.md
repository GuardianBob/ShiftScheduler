### General Info
The goal of the project is to provide a simplified and fast way for veterinarian practices (and other businesses) to be able to efficiently schedule staff and customize the calendar to meet the needs of the hospital.  A local veterinary emergency hospital was using calendars built in spreadsheets as their staff schedule.  These spreadsheets were manually created and updated with each staff member having to be individually added for each date they were scheduled to work.  Total shifts had to be manually counted bor each staff member for each month and for the full year.  

### Features
Functionality provided for the sponsoring hospital:
- Staff members can be added to multiple dates at once
- Shifts are automatically totaled for each staff member by month and year
- Security provided by requiring staff to register and log in to view schedule
- Shifts can be customized:
  - Start/End time
  - Color
  - Name/Type
- Shifts can be individually edited/deleted once assigned
- Shifts for individual staff can be deleted for selected dates or for an entire selected month
- entire month can be reset with a delete all shifts button
- Staff/Users have individual profiles with contact information
- Admin can reset passwords
- Staff can update passwords
- Staff can view their own shift count by type for each month and year
